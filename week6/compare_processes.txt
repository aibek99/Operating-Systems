Output comparison

                           Average TAT     Average WT
First Come First Served:          12.6              8   (FCFS)
Shortest Job Algorithm :           9.8            5.2   (SJA)
Round Robing Algorithm :            14            9.4   (RRA)

Quantum in case of round robin algorithm is: 2

FCFS - in this case average TAT and average WT is in the middle among this three algorithms
SJA  - in this case average TAT and average WT is minimum among this three algorithms' outputs
RRA  - in this case average TAT and average WT is maximum among this three algorithms' outputs
